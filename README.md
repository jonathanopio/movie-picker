This web application was build using React Native, and CSS elements. It uses a movie database API that I attained from themoviedb.org, and it is able to index multiple movies, add them to a personal list that is stored in local storage.


Future Prospects: 
TV Series indexer and selector, with an API similar to the themoviedb.org
